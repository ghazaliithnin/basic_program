Apart from formatting your time as minutes and seconds, you'll need to print a carriage return. Set end to \r:

import time

def countdown(t):
    while t:
        mins, secs = divmod(t, 60)
        timeformat = '{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(mins, secs)
        print(timeformat, end='\r')
        time.sleep(1)
        t -= 1
    print('Goodbye!\n\n\n\n\n')


This ensures that the next print overwrites the last line printed
